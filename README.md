# Weather Analysis for Surf Industry Business Forecasting
### The investment team for a breakout retailer in the surf industry has requested analysis of weather data for an identified potential city/site for a retail store. The investors specifically want analysis run on weather trends for temperature. There is a strong correlation between annual sales and renvenue from equipment rentail int he surf industry and temperature and the investment team wants to ensure that the city identified for the first potential location meets the minimum parameters for average temperature. 

## Results: 
### The analysis team used weather data gathered from stations around the city of Oahu. From this metadata the team parsed out temperature data for the months of June and December. From this data the investment team will draw conclusions about the financial viability of the new business.

  June    |     December

- Low Variability in Comparative Data Spread:
  - Very little deviation in all of the data points from eachother. 
- December has greater standard deviation of data:
  - we can conclue that the temperature is more volatile in December, more prone to relative 'extreme' highs and lows. You can see this represented in that December has a similar max temperature (only 2˚ cooler than June's max temperature) but a much cooler minimum observed temperature of 56˚ (compared to June's observered low of 64˚)

# Summary & Recommendations
### Great year round temperature with not a lot of instability. The analysis team recommends further digging and querying
- Analyze Precipitation Data: Overlay temperature with percipitation data. Also layer in data about storms as tropical regions and this could eliminate otherwise viable day for surfing and cut into profit.
- Elevation and Location of Data Collection Station: And relative proximity to Oahu. The data might be skewed if the stations are all closer in elevation to nearby mountainous regions.
- Compare & Contrast City Data Against other Locales: Compare weather analysis data to that of other cities in Oahu
- Business Analysis: How many other surf shops are there int he area. How successful are they. Population and tourism.
